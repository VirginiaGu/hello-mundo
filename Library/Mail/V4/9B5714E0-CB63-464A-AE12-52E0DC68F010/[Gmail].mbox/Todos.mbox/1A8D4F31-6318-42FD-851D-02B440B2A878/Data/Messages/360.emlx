Important Information for Test Day

Identification (ID) Requirements

You must present a valid ID with your name, signature and photograph to be admitted to the test center. The name you used when you registered must exactly match the name and signature on the ID you bring to the test center. If the information does not match, you will not be permitted to take the test and your test fee will not be refunded.

ID requirements vary based on your country of citizenship and where you plan to test. Be sure to visit www.ets.org/toefl/ibt/register/id to see the specific ID requirements for your location.

If your ID contains accented or diacritical characters that are not reflected in your test registration, you will still be permitted to take the test. Multiple first/given or last/family names should be entered together in the appropriate box. For example, if your name is "Jean-Louis Smith-Davis," enter "Jean-Louis" in the First/Given Name(s) box, and enter "Smith-Davis" in the Last/Family Name(s) box.

If you do not have a first name, you can leave that field blank as long as you enter a last name.

The Middle Name field is optional - however, if your ID shows a middle name, you should enter it so your registration name exactly matches your ID.

If it is discovered after your test that you did not meet the ID requirements, ETS may cancel your test scores, and your test fee will not be refunded.

Modifying Your Score Recipients

You can update your score recipients no later than 10:00 pm, local test center time, the day before your test. After that time, there is a fee to send additional score reports. Your free score recipients cannot be added, changed or deleted after the 10:00 pm deadline.                                                                                                     

Rescheduling Policy

You must reschedule your registration no later than 3 full days before your test date (not including the day of your test or the day of your request), or you will not receive a refund. For example, the deadline to reschedule a Saturday test date is Tuesday.

The fee to reschedule is US$60. Payment must be received before you can register for another test date.

Cancelation Policy

You must cancel your registration no later than 3 full days before your test date (not including the day of your test or the day of your request), or you will not receive a refund. For example, the deadline to cancel a Monday test date is Thursday.

Test Fee Refunds

If you cancel your registration before the 3-day advance deadline, you will receive a refund equivalent to half of the test fee you paid. The remainder of your payment will be retained to cover expenses for processing your registration and holding a seat for you at the test center. Refunds are in U.S. dollars. Cash refunds are not available. Refunds will not be given if you did not follow proper registration procedures or failed to present acceptable ID at the test center.

If you are taking the test in Korea, see  www.ets.org/toefl/ibt/register/changes/korea_refund_policy.

Instructions for Test Day

Report on time to the designated test center with the ID you used when you registered. If you arrive after the reporting time, you may not be admitted into the testing room.

Dress appropriately to account for temperature variations at the center. Other than your ID document(s), no personal items such as cell phones, handbags, or study materials will be allowed in the testing room. Test center staff will direct you on where to store personal belongings. Some test centers to do have secure storage space for test takers' belongings. At those test centers, test takers will be given a plastic bag for their personal items, which will be stored under their seats.

Instructions Prior to Start of Test

Please be aware that all test takers will not begin the Speaking section of the test at the same time. Other test takers may be speaking while you are working on another section of the test. If you think you will be distracted, we suggest you wear your headphones during the entire testing session.

Follow the instructions on the screen. Be sure that your microphone is properly positioned and adjusted to allow for the best possible recording. Speak directly into the microphone at your normal speaking volume.

Raters have been trained to ignore irrelevant noise when scoring speaking responses. They focus on the speaker's words and screen out background noise.
